          A native New Yorker by way of Manhattan, current New Jerseyan. I've spent half of my life
          moving back and forth between the two, so you could say I like the pizza and bagels here
          enough to stick around.{" "}

        <p>
          I've had a passion for technology and all things nerdy since I was first old enough to
          hold a Game Boy and tinker with my dad's MS-DOS work laptop, and that love of software and
          gadgets has been the core of my identity ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also maintained a love of the arts and humanities thanks to wonderful parents who
          took me to museums, plays, and everything in-between while growing up. I loved it so much
          that I pursued a <b>BFA from NYU</b> (with a <b>Minor in Web Design and Applications</b>
          ), and have spent the past 10 years pursuing acting and voice-over professionally in NYC.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an actor and narrator I've worked with some amazing clients, such as{" "}
          <b>Audible, Scholastic, Microsoft, Blizzard Entertainment, Nickelodeon,</b> and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once I knew I was ready for a change, I decided that it was time to pursue my other
          lifelong love of technology and software. I attended <b>Flatiron School</b> for their{" "}
          <b>Software Engineering</b> program, spending an incredible 15 weeks learning everything I
          could about modern web development and programming fundamentals.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've discovered an even deeper passion for programming and software development than ever
          before, and am continuing to learn new skills and chase my dream of bringing the arts,
          humanities, technology, and compassion together to make a difference in the world.
